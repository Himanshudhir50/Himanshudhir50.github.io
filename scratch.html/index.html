 <h1>SCRATCH</h1>
  <p>Scratch is a block-based visual programming language 
        and online community targeted primarily at children. 
        Users of the site can create online projects using a
         block-like interface. The service is developed by the 
         MIT Media Lab, has been translated into 70+ languages, and
          is used in most parts of the world.[1] Scratch is taught and 
          used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges, as well as
          other public knowledge institutions. As of May 2019, community 
          statistics on the language's official website sh
         more than 40 million projects shared by over 40 million users, and 
         almost 40 million monthly website visits.</p>
