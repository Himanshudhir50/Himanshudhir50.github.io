<p>Oregon State University - Cascades (OSU-Cascades) is a branch campus of Oregon State University (OSU) located in Bend, Oregon. It is the only university in Central Oregon that offers both baccalaureate and graduate programs. OSU-Cascades also offers professional pathways and certificate programs.The 10-acre campus is the first public university to open in Oregon in more than 50 years. The campus plans to expand academically with new degree programs over a 10-year period</p>
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>In August 2012, the Oregon State Board of Higher Education approved OSU's 
    plan to expand the campus into a four-year school.
    Oregon State University planned to add freshman and sophomore level classes 
    to the Cascades campus as early as 2015, though it was not decided if the current 
    location would be used or if a new campus would be built. During the 2013 legislative session, the Oregon Legislative Assembly approved $16 million in construction bonds to finance a new, expanded four-year campus in Bend for OSU-Cascades. A supplement of $8 million in philanthropic funds and campus-supported bonds would create a financing package totaling $24 million.
     A suitable building site would require 40 to 60 acres.</p>

<h1>CAMPUS</h1>
<P>The campus, which opened in 2001 and operated in Cascades Hall at Central Oregon Community College, began offering four-year degrees by Fall 2015. The campus is currently seated on 10 acres (4.0 ha) of land, with four buildings on it (one of which is operated by the Bend Science Station). A fifth building, the Graduate and Research Center (GRC), is located a half-mile away near Deschutes Brewery. The GRC houses faculty offices and classrooms utilized by all Cascades students.

        Tykeson Hall, named for businessman and philanthropist Don Tykeson, was opened in Fall 2016, and contains the majority of classrooms on campus. The building also houses faculty offices, administrative offices, and labs.
        
        The Cascades Student Residence (CSR), which can house up to 304 students, is the university's only residence hall. The campus dining and academic building, Obsidian Hall, can hold up to 250 students. Both buildings were opened in January 2017.</P>
